We conducted a case study with a real world data, which is well-known for the use in Gapminder~\cite{gapminder}, to evaluate the usability of our system.
We choose life expectancy and income as the x axis and y axis, respectively. And we use world regions as the class label. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:casestudy}, due to the limit space, we only show three years. And to make it easy to read, we removed the points with a much larger x value or y value.

We first used the default settings of our system to automatically produce a color assignment result based on Tableau 20 palette for assigning colors to different objects in the dataset, see Fig.~\ref{fig:casestudy}(a). Since $\kappa$ is $0$ and all the classes are changed, each class is assigned with a salient color to make it more distinguishable. This result is similar to \emph{Optimized Assignment}~\cite{Wang2018} while our result considers the different importance of classes, i.e., larger importance value has a more salient color.
Then we want to explore the two classes with the largest change degree, thus we move the $\kappa$ control point(the black circle in control panel) to a larger value, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:casestudy}(b). Now we can see the largest changed classes more clearly. But the visual separability between the classes with lower $\kappa$ value is small, such as the color of \emph{Middle East \& North Africa} and \emph{Europe \& Central Asia}. We further generate the result by our palette generation method which has a better performance on discriminability, see Fig.~\ref{fig:casestudy}(c).
Through our exploration, we found that \emph{South Asia} should not have a large change degree. This result is caused by our default class importance measure which sets point number change a larger weight in Eq.~\ref{eq:cm}, this is done due to the previous evaluation result that point number change is harder to distinguish than point position change.

Our system also supports manually class importance adjustment, we illustrate this in Fig.~\ref{fig:casestudyinteraction}. For example, we are interested in \emph{America}, thus we can increase the importance value of the corresponding circle and meanwhile, decrease other classes' importance value until lower than $\kappa$. We show both assignment result for user provided palette and automatic palette generation result. It's obvious that both results highlight the interested class while palette generation method leads to a much better visual separability between different classes.
